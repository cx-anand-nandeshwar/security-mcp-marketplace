## Overview

The Checkmarx Security MCP Server exposes Checkmarx One's application security platform as natural-language-accessible tools for AI coding assistants. Once configured, you can trigger security scans, investigate findings, and receive AI-generated remediation suggestions directly from your IDE or AI agent.

**Supported scan engines:**
- **SAST** — Static Application Security Testing (30+ languages)
- **SCA** — Software Composition Analysis (open-source dependencies)
- **KICS** — Infrastructure as Code security (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Dockerfile)
- **Secret Detection** — Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens

**Supported transport protocols:**
- `stdio` — Standard input/output for CLI or embedded agents
- `sse` — Server-Sent Events for real-time streaming
- `http` (streamableHttp) — HTTP-compatible stream-based messaging

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the MCP server you need:

1. A **Checkmarx One** tenant with valid credentials
2. Your **Checkmarx API host** (e.g., `ast.checkmarx.net`) — provided by your Checkmarx administrator
3. Your **tenant ID** (e.g., `cx_eu`, `checkmarx`)
4. An **API key** if using API Key authentication (see [authentication.md](authentication.md))
5. An MCP-compatible AI client (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

---

## Quick Start

1. Obtain your API host and tenant ID from your Checkmarx administrator.
2. Generate an API key from the Checkmarx One portal (or use OAuth2 — see [authentication.md](authentication.md)).
3. Add the MCP server to your client configuration — see [examples/](../examples/) for ready-to-use configs.
4. Ask your AI assistant: *"Scan my project for security vulnerabilities"* or *"Show me the latest findings for project X"*.

| `listScans` | List scans with status, date range, and branch filters |
| `listFindings` | List vulnerabilities from a scan with severity filtering |
| `getFindingDetails` | Get detailed information for a specific finding |

**Example prompts:**
- *"Scan my current project for security issues"*
- *"What scan engines should I use for this Node.js project?"*
- *"Show me all critical findings from the last scan"*
- *"Get details on finding ID abc123"*

---

### Project Management

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `resolveProject` | Look up a project by name (returns exact match, candidates, or not found) |
| `createProject` | Create a new Checkmarx One project |
| `listProjects` | Browse or search all projects |
| `getProjectConfig` | Get full project configuration |

**Example prompts:**
- *"Find the project named my-api"*

**Example prompts:**
- *"Give me a risk summary for my tenant"*
- *"How many critical vulnerabilities were introduced this month?"*
- *"Mark finding XYZ as NOT_EXPLOITABLE"*

---

### Remediation

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `codeRemediation` | AI-generated fixes for SAST findings, secrets, and IaC misconfigurations |
| `packageRemediation` | Safe upgrade paths for vulnerable open-source packages (npm, Maven, PyPI, Go, NuGet) |
| `imageRemediation` | Secure base image alternatives for vulnerable container images |

**Example prompts:**

- *"What's the safe version of lodash to fix this CVE?"*
- *"Suggest a secure base image for my Dockerfile"*

---

## MCP Resources

The server exposes these read-only resources for context:

| Resource URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `cxone://engines` | Supported scan engine definitions |
| `cxone://severity-levels` | Vulnerability severity level definitions |
| `cxone://finding-states` | Finding lifecycle states |
| `cxone://scan-statuses` | Scan execution status definitions |
| `cxone://capabilities` | Server capabilities and tool routing rules |

---

## MCP Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|---|---|
| `security-scan` | Guided end-to-end scan workflow — engine selection, project resolution, and results |

Use the `security-scan` prompt to let the AI assistant walk you through a complete security scan interactively.

## Example Workflows

### End-to-End Security Scan

```
1. "What scan engines should I use for this project?"     → planScan
2. "Scan the project my-api on the main branch"           → triggerScan
3. "Is the scan done? Show me the results"                → getScanDetails
4. "List all HIGH and CRITICAL findings"                  → listFindings
5. "Fix the SQL injection in finding #12"                 → codeRemediation
```

### Vulnerability Triage

```
1. "Show me the risk summary for my tenant"               → getRiskSummary
2. "List all CONFIRMED critical risk results"             → listRiskResults
3. "Mark finding ABC as NOT_EXPLOITABLE with a note"      → updateRiskResultStatus
```

### Dependency Security

```
1. "Scan my project for vulnerable dependencies"          → triggerScan (SCA)
2. "List all HIGH severity SCA findings"                  → listFindings
3. "What's the safe version of express to fix CVE-XXXX?"  → packageRemediation
```
